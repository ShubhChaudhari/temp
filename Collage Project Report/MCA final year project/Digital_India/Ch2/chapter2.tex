\section{System Requirement Analysis}
At system requirement analysis stage the information gathering process is identified a Smart devices fueled by the hyper-connected Internet of Things (IoT) are becoming
ever more prevalent and pervasive in our personal lives. Sensors are everywhere, and the trend will only continue. Today, sensor-equipped industrial equipment is powered by artificial intelligence (AI). Medical devices can self-diagnose and send alerts to patients and doctors to remotely manage healthcare. Automobiles with in-car connectivity can download new features on the fly. Very soon, refrigerators will plan your dinner and ovens will know how to cook it.
