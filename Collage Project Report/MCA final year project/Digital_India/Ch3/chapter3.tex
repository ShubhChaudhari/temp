\chapter{Feasibility Study}


\section{Introduction}
the working of the system, \\
Therefore, a feasibility study of the proposed system needs to be carried out in order to:\\
\textbullet \hspace{0.2cm} 	Provide a better understanding of the System.\\
\textbullet \hspace{0.2cm}	Describe the outputs.\\

There are many factors. These factors are \textbf{Economical Feasibility, Technical Feasibility and Operational Feasibility}.\\

\section{Economical Feasibility}
\textbullet \hspace{0.2cm}Economic Feasibility helps in determining whether the required software has the potential to generate financial gains for an organization.\\
\textbullet \hspace{0.2cm}The only person working here is an admin. So due to reduced manpower,the cost of wages is also reduced. Hence making it cheaper.\\

\section{Operational Feasibility}
\textbullet \hspace{0.2cm}The GUI is designed to be user friendly, so it is easy to use by admin. There is only one user which handles the website i.e., Admin. So, the manpower required is less here.\\
\textbullet \hspace{0.2cm}This software will have a very easy to use, user friendly interface so it will be pretty much operable by anyone having little experience with android or iOS phone.\\
\section{Financial and Economical Feasibility}

\textbullet \hspace{0.2cm}This type of study involves the cost incurred on the team of the software development, cost of study involved in conducting a feasibility study,
estimated cost of software and hardware.\\
\textbullet \hspace{0.2cm}Here the cost of hardware is affordable
